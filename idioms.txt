you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink
you can say that again
you can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs
you can’t take it with you
you can’t teach an old dog new tricks
you can’t win them all
you know better than that
you rock
you wish
young at heart
young blood
young turk
your call
your guess is as good as mine
your sins will find you out
yours truly
you’re on
you’ve got to be kidding
you’ve made your bed
zenith of career or life
zero hour
zero in on
zero tolerance
zero-sum game
zig when one should be zagging
zip it
zip one's lip
zip past
zip your lip
zone out
zonk out
zoom away
zoom off
